USER MANUAL:

Place the .fasta file (and query file)into the Assignment/Assignment1/bin/Debug folder.
Output files from the program will also be saved into the Assignment/Assignment1/bin/Debug folder.

To build: Open the Assignment1.sln file which can be found in Assignment/Assignment1, and build by either clicking 'Build' or holding down keys CTRL+SHIFT+B.

To run the program from the command line:
Enter:
	cd .../Assignment/Assignment1/bin/Debug
	Assignment1.exe

There are 3 search levels:

Level 1:	Sequential access using a starting position in the file. 
		Example: Search16s -level1 filename.fasta 273 10 					
		Example: Search16s -level1 16S.fasta 273 N > myfile.fasta 

			Search16s is the program name, -level1 is a flag indicating the type of search required, filename.fasta is the fasta file name to read from, 
			273 is the line number to start the output from, and 10 is the number of sequences that the program should output.
			The program will capture the output in a file called myfile.fasta in the current directory. N is the number of sequences to output.

Level 2: 	Sequential access to a specific sequence by sequence-id.
		Example: Search16s -level2 16S.fasta NR_115365.1

			The program will respond by displaying to the console the respective sequence lines.

Level 3: 	Sequential access to find a set of sequence-ids given in a query file, and writing the output to a specified result file.
		Example: Search16s -level3 16S.fasta query.txt results.txt

			Query filename – in the example it is query.txt – is specified on the command line. The
			file contains a set of sequence-ids. The program writes out all matching sequences to the
			specified results file (not to the console). Sequence-ids that are not found should however
			be output to the console with a suitable error message.
